This program is a simple and tiny example of how an API Health Monitoring system would look like:

- Interfaces grouping Endpoints, Environment, Health Checks and Results
- Functions for single API checks, Overall Environment's API chcks and repeated monitoring
- Specific system tests

  Run with commands:
  1. tsc
  2. node dist/Health-Check.js
